The open-source security analytics.

tirreno helps you to understand, monitor, and protect your platforms from cyber fraud, account threats, and abuse. Proactively defend against internal and external threats, ensure sovereignty through on-premises deployment, and secure your digital platforms:

* **Proactive monitoring and granular visibility**: Understand your application with detailed event tracking and smart monitoring. Capture all events: logins/logouts, data modification, page visits, API calls, along with user context and application errors to get complete operational awareness.
* **Continuous monitoring**: Monitor user behaviour in near real time by choosing from a list of relevant event types. Proactively find cyberfraud, account threats, and abuse in your digital platform, and respond to threats quickly based on in-app intelligence.
* **Single user view**: Get comprehensive visibility into individual user activity. Analyze behavior patterns, risk scores, connected identities, and activity timelines for specific users. Investigate suspicious activity and review detailed session data to make informed security decisions.
* **User risk assessment**: Set up security rules to automatically identify malicious activity, and assess risk tailored to your specific requirements.
* **Case management and auto-decision**: Accounts with risky events are sent to manual review or automatic suspension. Security team can investigate flagged cases and make informed decisions based on comprehensive security analytics.
* **Field audit trail**: Automatically track modifications to important fields, including what changed and when. Centralized field audit trail lets you easily review data changes, streamlining audit and compliance.
* **Enhanced threat intelligence**: tirreno can be enhanced with first-party threat intelligence via API enrichment. Eliminate blind spots and get the threat intelligence you need to build a multi-layered defense against fraud. (Optional)

tirreno is a "low-tech" PHP and PostgreSQL software application that can be downloaded and installed on your own web server. After a straightforward five-minute installation process, you can immediately access real-time threat analytics.

## Quickstart install

1. [Download](https://www.tirreno.com/download.php) the latest version of tirreno (ZIP file).
2. Extract the tirreno-master.zip file to the location where you want it installed on your web server.
3. Navigate to `http://your-domain.example/install/index.php` in a browser to launch the installation process.
4. After the successful installation, delete the `install/` directory and its contents.
5. Navigate to `http://your-domain.example/signup/` in a browser to create administrator account.
6. For cron jobs setup insert the following schedule (every 10 minutes) expression with `crontab -e` command or by editing `/var/spool/cron/your-web-server` file:

```
*/10 * * * * cd /path/to/tirreno && /usr/bin/php /path/to/tirreno/index.php /cron >> /path/to/tirreno/assets/logs/error.log 2>&1
```

## Using a docker-based installation (optional)

To run tirreno within docker container you may use image published on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tirreno/tirreno).

```bash
docker pull tirreno/tirreno:latest
```

## Using Heroku (optional)

Click [here](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/tirrenotechnologies/tirreno) to launch heroku deployment.

## Documentation

See the [User Guide](https://docs.tirreno.com/) for details on how to use tirreno.

## Optional non-free capabilities

The open-sourced tirreno code is intended to be used for free as a standalone application. It provides general statistics, rule engine and risk-based alerting to a monitored system. As is, this tooling may be sufficient for bringing insights about user activity and behavioral patterns in a wide range of use cases, especially as a solution for small and medium-sized organizations.

However, if you are looking to cover more advanced usage scenarios, such as cyber fraud prevention, the additional tirreno API enrichment capabilities can be enabled via [monthly-paid subscription](https://www.tirreno.com/pricing/). It supplies extended information on any of the following: IP address, email address, domain, and phone number. Enabling all the data enrichment types augments tirreno into a fully-fledged enterprise solution for an online fraud prevention system.

## About

The tirreno project started as a proprietary system in 2021 and was open-sourced (AGPL) in December 2024.

Behind tirreno is a blend of extraordinary engineers and professionals, with over a decade of experience in online business operations. We solve real people's challenges through love in ascétique code and sovereign technologies.

tirreno is not VC-motivated. Our inspiration comes from the daily threats posed by organized cybercriminals, driving us to reimagine protection that has never existed before.

The tirreno wordmark stands beyond the horizon line, as a metaphor for the evolutionary cycle of the threat landscape, and our commitment to stay ahead of it.

## Why the name tirreno?

History suggests that the Tyrrhenian people may have lived in Tuscany and eastern Switzerland as far back as 800 BC. The term "Tyrrhenian” became more commonly associated with the Etruscans, and it is from them that the Tyrrhenian Sea derives its name — a name still in use today. This name is believed to be an exonym, possibly meaning “tower”.

While working on the logo, we conducted our own historical study and traced mentions of 'tirreno' back to the 15th-century printed edition of the Vulgate (the Latin Bible). We kept it lowercase to stay true to the original — quite literally, by the book.

The tirreno wordmark, positioned beyond a horizon line, as a metaphor for the constant evolution of the fraud landscape and our commitment to staying ahead of change.
